A simple linear regression is easy to understand, but represents the basis of regression techniques. Once these concepts are understood, it will be easier for us to address the other types of regression.\n",
    "\n",
    "The linear regression method consists of precisely identifying a line that is capable of representing point distribution in a two-dimensional plane, that is, if the points corresponding to the observations are near the line, then the chosen model will be able to describe the link between the variables effectively. \n",
    "\n",
    "In theory, there are an infinite number of lines that may approximate the observations, while in practice, there is only one mathematical model that optimizes the representation of the data. In the case of a linear mathematical relationship, the observations of the y variable can be obtained by a linear function of the observations of the x variable. For each observation, we will use the following formula:\n",
    "\n",
    "$y = \\alpha \\times x + \\beta$\n",

    "In the preceding formula, x is the explanatory variable and y is the response variable. The Î± and Î² parameters, which represent the slope of the line and the intercept with the y-axis respectively, must be estimated based on the observations collected for the two variables included in the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "The slope, $\\alpha$, is of particular interest, that is, the variation of the mean response for every single increment of the explanatory variable. What about a change in this coefficient? If the slope is positive, the regression line increases from left to right, and if the slope is negative, the line decreases from left to right. When the slope is zero, the explanatory variable has no effect on the value of the response. But it is not just the sign of Î± that establishes the weight of the relationship between the variables. More generally, its value is also important. In the case of a positive slope, the mean response is higher when the explanatory variable is higher, while in the case of a negative slope, the mean response is lower when the explanatory variable is higher.\n",

This in turn reduces the sum of squares of differences between the actual output and the predicted output using a linear function. This method is called ordinary least squares.

    "**Ridge regression is a regularization method** where a **penalty is imposed on the size of the coefficients**. **Ridge regression is identical to least squares**, barring the fact that **ridge coefficients are computed by decreasing a quantity that is somewhat different**. In ridge regression, a scale transformation has a substantial effect. Therefore, to avoid obtaining different results depending on the predicted scale of measurement, **it is advisable to standardize all predictors before estimating the model**. To standardize the variables, we must *subtract their means and divide by their standard deviations*."

    "One of the main constraints of a linear regression model is the fact that **it tries to fit a linear function to the input data**. The polynomial regression model overcomes this issue **by allowing the function to be a polynomial**, thereby increasing the accuracy of the model."

    "##### Getting ready\n",
    "Polynomial models should be applied **where the relationship between response and explanatory variables is curvilinear**. Sometimes, polynomial models can also be used **to model a non-linear relationship in a small range of explanatory variable**. A polynomial quadratic (squared) or cubic (cubed) term **converts a linear regression model into a polynomial curve**. However, since it is the explanatory variable that is squared or cubed and not the beta coefficient, it is still considered as a linear model. This makes it a simple and easy way to model curves, without needing to create big non-linear models"

  {
   "cell_type": "markdown",
   "metadata": {},
   "source": [
    "The curviness of a model is controlled by the degree of the polynomial. As the curviness of the model increases, it gets more accurate. However, **curviness adds complexity to the model as well, making it slower**. This is a trade-off: **you have to decide how accurate you want your model to be given the computational constraints**."

This combines the outputs from different versions of the algorithms, called **weak learners**, using a weighted summation to get the final output. The information that's collected at each stage of the AdaBoost algorithm is fed back into the system so that the learners at the latter stages focus on training samples that are difficult to classify. In this way, it increases the accuracy of the system.\n",

    "Using Adaboost, we fit a regressor on the dataset. We compute the error and then fit the regressor on the same dataset again, based on this error estimate. We can think of tis as fine-tuning on the regressor until the desired accuracy is achieved. You are given a dataset that contains various parameters that affect the price of a house. Our goal is to estimate the relationship between these parameters and the house price so that we can use this to estimate the price given unknown input parameters."

    "Feature importance provides a measure that indicates the value of each feature in the construction of a model. The more an attribute is used to build a model, the greater its relative importance.

The more an attribute is used to make predictions with decision trees, the greater its relative importance. This importance is explicitly calculated for each attribute in the dataset, allowing you to classify and compare attributes to each other."

The first two columns correspond to the serial number and the actual date, so we won't use them for our analysis. The last three columns correspond to different types of outputs. The last column is just the sum of the values in the fourteenth and fifteenth columns, so we can leave those two out when we build our model. Let's go ahead and see how to do this in Python. We will analyze the code line by line to understand each step."

    "##### How it works\n",
    "**A random forest is a special regressor formed of a set of simple regressors (decision trees)**, represented as **independent and identically distributed random vectors**, where each one chooses the mean prediction of the individual trees. This type of structure has made significant improvements in regression accuracy and falls within the sphere of ensemble learning. Each tree within a random forest is constructed and trained from a random subset of the data in the training set. The trees therefore do not use the complete set, and the best attribute is no longer selected for each node, but the best attribute is selected from a set of randomly selected attributes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Randomness is a factor that then becomes part of the construction of regressors and aims to increase their diversity and thus reduce correlation. The final result returned by the random forest is nothing but the average of the numerical result returned by the different trees in the case of a regression, or the class returned by the largest number of trees if the random forest algorithm was used to perform classification."

    "Let's see what happens when you include the fourteenth and fifteenth columns in the dataset. In the feature importance graph, every feature other than these two has to go to zero. The reason is that the output can be obtained by simply summing up the fourteenth and fifteenth columns, so the algorithm doesn't need any other features to compute the output. Make the following change inside the for loop (the rest of the code remains unchanged):"

    "As expected, it says that only these two features are important. This makes sense intuitively because the final output is a simple summation of these two features. So, there is a direct relationship between these two variables and the output value. Hence, the regressor says that it doesn't need any other variable to predict the output. This is an extremely useful tool to eliminate redundant variables in your dataset. But this is not the only difference from the previous model. If we analyze the model's performance, we can see a substantial improvement:\n",
