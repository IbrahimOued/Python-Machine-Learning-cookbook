    "Time series data is basically a sequence of measurements that are collected over time. These measurements are taken with respect to a predetermined variable and at regular time intervals. One of the main characteristics of time series data is that the ordering matters!\n",

    "The list of observations that we collect is ordered on a timeline, and the order in which they appear says a lot about underlying patterns. If you change the order, this would totally change the meaning of the data. Sequential data is a generalized notion that encompasses any data that comes in a sequential form, including time series data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our objective here is to build a model that describes the pattern of the time series or any sequence in general. Such models are used to describe important features of the time series pattern. We can use these models to explain how the past might affect the future. We can also use them to see how two datasets can be correlated, to forecast future values, or to control a given variable that is based on some metric.\n",

    "To visualize time series data, we tend to plot it using line charts or bar graphs. Time series data analysis is frequently used in finance, signal processing, weather prediction, trajectory forecasting, predicting earthquakes, or any field where we have to deal with temporal data. The models that we build in time series and sequential data analysis should take into account the ordering of data and extract the relationships among neighbors. Let's go ahead and check out a few recipes to analyze time series and sequential data in Python."

To slice means to cut, while to dice means to cut food into very small and uniform sections, and the two actions are often performed in sequence. In data analysis, the term slice and dice generally involves a systematic reduction of a large dataset into smaller parts to extract more information."
