    "**Predictive modeling** is probably one of the most exciting fields in data analytics. It has gained a lot of attention in recent years due to massive amounts of data being available in many different verticals. It is very commonly used in areas concerning data mining to forecast future trends.\n",
    "\n",
    "Predictive modeling is an analysis technique that is used to predict the future behavior of a system. It is a collection of algorithms that can identify the relationship between independent input variables and the target responses. We create a mathematical model, based on observations, and then use this model to estimate what's going to happen in the future.\n",
    "\n",
    "In predictive modeling, we need to collect data with known responses to train our model. Once we create this model, we validate it using some metrics, and then use it to predict future values. We can use many different types of algorithms to create a predictive model. In this chapter, we will use SVMs to build linear and nonlinear models.\n",
    "\n",
    "A predictive model is built using a number of features that are likely to influence the behavior of the system. For example, to estimate weather conditions, we may use various types of data, such as temperature, barometric pressure, precipitation, and other atmospheric processes. Similarly, when we deal with other types of systems, we need to decide what factors are likely to influence its behavior and include them as part of the feature vector before training our model."

    "SVMs are **a set of supervised learning methods** that can be used for b**oth classification and regression**. Given two classes of **linearly separable multidimensional patterns**, **among all the possible separating hyperplanes, the SVM algorithm determines `the one able to separate the classes with the greatest possible margin`**. The margin is the **minimum distance of the points in the two classes** in the training set from the hyperplane identified. \n",

    "Maximization of the margin is linked to generalization. If the training set patterns are classified with a large margin, you can hope that even test-set patterns close to the boundary between the classes are managed correctly. In the following, you can see three lines (**l1**, **l2**, and **l3**). Line **l1** does not separate the two classes, line **l2** separates them, but with a small margin, while line **l3** maximizes the distance between the two classes:\n",

    "**SVMs** constitute a class of learning machines recently introduced in the literature. SVMs derive from concepts concerning the statistical theory of learning and present theoretical generalization properties. The theory that governs the functioning mechanisms of SVMs was introduced by Vapnik in 1965 (statistical learning theory), and was more recently perfected, in 1995, by Vapnik himself, and others. SVMs are one of **the most widely used tools for pattern classification**. Instead of estimating the probability densities of classes, Vapnik suggests directly solving the problem of interest, that is, to determine the decisional surfaces between the classes (classification boundaries)."

    "Stacked generalization works by **deducing the biases of the classifier/regressor relative to a supplied learning dataset**. This **deduction works by generalizing into a second space whose inputs are the hypotheses of the original generalizers and whose output is the correct hypothesis**. When **used with multiple generators**, stacked generalization is an **alternative to cross-validation**. "

    "StackNet is a **framework implemented in Java based on Wolpert's stacked generalization on multiple levels to improve accuracy in machine learning predictive problems**. The StackNet model functions as a neural network in which **the transfer function takes the form of any supervised machine learning algorithm**."
